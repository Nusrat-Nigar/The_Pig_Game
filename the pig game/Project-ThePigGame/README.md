# Project-ThePigGame
• This is a two-player game. Click on the "Roll the Dice" button to roll the dice.
• The number you roll on the dice will be added to your current score.
• You can choose to either hold your score and let the other player roll the dice or keep rolling the dice.
• To add your held score to your main score, click on the "Hold" button.
• If you roll a 1 on the dice, your current score will be deducted to zero, and it will be the other player's turn to roll the dice.
• The first player to reach 100 points is declared the winner.
